# Visitor-Counter

Count no. of people passing through a door using IR sensors and Arduino.

The circuit was designed in 2 different ways viz. with Arduino and without Arduino. The circuit without Arduino uses different electronic components to count the no. of visitors while the other one replaces those components with an Arduino and few lines of code to give us the desired output.
